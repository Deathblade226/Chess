This project is an update to Jgrindal's CSChess his open Source Chess Game for Windows written in C# (https://github.com/jgrindal/CSChess). We have taken his open source and modified it a bit to be a fischer random chess game.

CSChess can be used by two players to play against each other or a single player game against a simple AI, or awkwardly watch while the computer plays itself.

Features we have added are the ability to play chess using the Fischer Random Chess layout while still having the ability to play chess normaly.
